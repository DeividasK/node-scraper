A guest cloakroom/WC is conveniently positioned adjacent to the kitchen with access into the cellar, ideal for storage. The stylish kitchen has an island/breakfast bar and integrated appliances throughout including zoned lighting and boasts engineered wood flooring which runs throughout the ground floor.The first floor comprises three double bedrooms, two of relatively equal proportions and a larger third positioned to the rear, each carpeted, with double glazed timber sash windows to the front and class A PVC double glazing to the rear. A contemporary bathroom is to the front of the house, benefiting from a shower over the bath. The first floor landing has built in storage which accommodates a washing machine and has additional space for a dryer - removing the noise from the open plan living space downstairs.
